## `<ng-ais-breadcrumb />`

A breadcrumb is a secondary navigation scheme that allows the user to see where the current page is in relation to the website or web application’s hierarchy. In terms of usability, using a breadcrumb reduces the number of actions a visitor needs to take in order to get to a higher-level page.
